                <div class="about-text scroll-fade">
                    <p>I've built multiple profitable ventures before 20, from reselling to crypto to digital products. I have a track record of finding early arbitrage, moving fast, and learning in public, and now I'm focused on building high-leverage, long-term impact products.</p>
                    
                    <p>My story isn't one big win, it's a series of pivots, mistakes, rebuilds, and lessons that compound. Right now, I'm building Metriq, a gamified competition app powered by Apple Health. I'm learning product, leadership, and execution by doing, every single day.</p>
                    
                    <p>I want to build companies that last, I want the freedom that comes from being undeniable, and I want to take care of the people who believed in me before I believed in myself.</p>

                    <p>I do this for my family, for God, and for the man I'm becoming. I'm not where I want to be yet, but I know where I'm going.</p>

                            <p>I was born in Seoul and moved to Chicago at four. We lived in a small apartment, barely getting by, but my parents made sure I was happy.</p>
                            
                            <p>At a school field day, every kid wore matching jerseys. I showed up in a plain white shirt with my name hand-written by my mom. I didn't understand it then, but that moment stuck.</p>
                            
                            <p>We moved to Atlanta when I was 13. That's when I stopped waiting and started moving. I opened my first Robinhood account with $300, blew it on penny stocks, and pivoted fast.</p>
                            
                            <p>I went all in on sneaker reselling, built Instagram pages to 200K+ followers, launched a membership group, and hit $3.5K MRR by 15 â€” enough to help my parents with the mortgage. I didn't love the work, but I learned how to move fast, spot opportunity early, and turn value into income.</p>

                        <div class="chapter-text">
                            <p>During COVID, I ran $5K up to $500K in crypto, and then watched it crash. Most would've stayed down, but I knew I'd bounce back. Stupid optimism and unwavering self-belief have always been my greatest edges.</p>
                            
                            <p>From 2022 to 2024, I scaled reselling to $3.8M in revenue. It wasn't glamorous, but it trained me in high-pressure execution, lean operations, and quick adaptation.</p>
                            
                            <p>When markets bounced back, I ran $150K to $5.5M, then lost most of it again. I was still ahead, but I was stuck in a loop: chase, win, drift, repeat.</p>
                            
                            <p>So in early 2025, I paused. Not to quit, but to evolve. I stopped playing short-term games and started asking bigger questions: what would it look like to build something that lasts, something real?</p>
                            
                            <p>That's when the mission changed, from profit-chasing to legacy-building.</p>

                            <p>Now I'm building Metriq, a gamified competitive fitness app powered by Apple Health. It makes consistency feel like a game using leaderboards, streaks, points, and peer pressure. We're using social dynamics to hardwire behavior change.</p>
                            
                            <p>But this isn't just about one app. This is about becoming the kind of man the people I admire would respect, to reach my highest potential, and to lead alongside those who shape the world.</p>
                            
                            <p>I don't have all the answers. But I ship, I learn in public, and I refuse to lose momentum.</p>
