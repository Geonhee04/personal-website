                I’ve built multiple profitable ventures before 20, from reselling to crypto to digital products.
I have a track record of finding early arbitrage, moving fast, and learning in public.
Now I’m focused on building high-leverage, long-term impact products.

                    <p>Right now, I’m building Metriq, a fitness competition app powered by Apple Health. I’m learning product, leadership, and execution by doing, every single day.</p>
                    
                    <p>I want to build companies that last. I want the freedom that comes from being undeniable. And I want to take care of the people who believed in my before I believed in myself.</p>

                    <p>I do this for my family, for God, and for the man I'm becoming. I'm not where I want to be yet, but I know where I'm going.</p>

                            <p>I was born in Seoul and moved to Chicago when I was four. We grew up in a small apartment, but my parents always made sure I was happy, even when we didn’t have much.</p>
                            
                            <p>The first time I realized we were struggling was during a school field day. Everyone had matching $15 jerseys. I wore a plain white shirt with my name hand-written by my mom. I didn’t understand it then, but that moment stuck. It planted a seed. If I wanted more, I’d have to earn it.</p>

                            <p>I opened my first Robinhood account at 13, using $300 of birthday money I'd saved up. I tried penny stocks, got wrecked, and so I pivoted. </p>
                            
                            <p>Started reselling sneakers, streetwear and built IG pages with over 200,000 combined followers. By 15, I was making $3500 MRR from my membership group and helped my parents pay for our house.</p>
                            
                            <p>I didn't love the work, but I learned how to spot opportunity early, how to market, and how to create value.</p>

                            <p>When COVID hit, crypto and NFTs blew up. I turned $5K into $500K, then back down to $25K when the market crashed.</p>
                            
                            <p>Most people would’ve been wrecked, but I wasn’t. I knew I could do it again. That’s always been my greatest edge: stupid optimism and unwavering self-belief.</p>
                            
                            <p>So I went back to what I knew. From 2022 to 2024, I scaled reselling hard, pulling in $3.8M in revenue. It wasn’t glamorous, but it taught me how to move fast, operate under pressure, and keep stacking when the game changed.</p>
                            
                            <p>Then the markets came back and I went all in. Turned $150K into $5.5M. Every lesson from 2020 felt like it had finally paid off. And then I lost most of it again.</p>
