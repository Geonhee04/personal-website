                    <p>I used to trade and I made a lot of money pretty early. But I felt like an imposter and I didn't like who I was becoming. I spent most days staring at a screen, disconnected from people, purpose, and myself.</p>
                    
                    <p>So I stopped, I walked away, and started over.</p>
                    
                    <p>Now I'm rebuilding everything from scratch. One habit, one purpose, and one hard day at a time. I'm training Jiu Jitsu, leading Metriq, learning to market, teaching myself to think clearly, act with weight, and live with intent.</p>

                    <p>I do this for my family, for God, and for the man I'm becoming. I'm not where I want to be yet, but I know where I'm going.</p>

                            <p>I was born in Seoul, South Korea, on August 1st. At 4, my family moved to Chicago, chasing a better future. We grew up in a small apartment, but my parents always made sure I was happy.</p>
                            
                            <p>I didn't realize we were poor, not until a field day in elementary school. Everyone wore matching $15 jerseys. My mom grabbed a plain white shirt, wrote my name and number on it. I was extremely embarrassed back then, but now, I see it for what it was: love and sacrifice. A gesture that means everything to me now.</p>

                            <p>We moved to Atlanta when I was 13. That's where the hustle started.</p>
                            
                            <p>At 13, I opened a Robinhood account under my dad's name. October 23rd, 2017, my first recorded trade. I used $300 of birthday money and dove into penny stocks. It didn't go great.</p>
                            
                            <p>So I pivoted. Started reselling sneakers and streetwear in high school. By sophomore year, I'd made $30,000, enough to help pay part of my parents' down payment when we moved into a house in 2020.</p>
                            
                            <p>I built Instagram sneaker pages with over 200,000 combined followers. Started a sneaker membership group that hit $3,500 MRR at age 15. Sold everything for $10,000 and walked away. I didn't love the work, but I learned how to move, how to market, and how to create value.</p>

                            <p>When COVID hit, crypto and NFTs blew up. I turned $5K into $500K, then back down to $25K when the market crashed.</p>
                            
                            <p>Most people would've been destroyed by that, but I wasn't. I knew I could do it again. That's my edge: stupid optimism and unwavering self-belief.</p>
                            
                            <p>I skipped college. Tried dropshipping and failed. Tried learning to code and hated it. </p>
                            
                            <p>So I returned to what I knew: reselling. I didn't love it, but I scaled it hard, $3.7M in revenue between 2022 and early 2024. Then crypto came back and I went all in. I was able to turn $150K into $5.5M. I felt like every lesson from 2020 had paid off. Then I lost most of it again.</p>

                            <p>This time, I paused. Not to quit, but to change the why.</p>
                            
                            <p>I started learning to build. Not just to make money, but to make something real. I started tracking my habits, journaling, reflecting, leading my first product, and learning how to market.</p>
